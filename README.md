# js8bbs
Python-based framework for building a Bulletin Board System using JS8Call as the modem.  This is intended as a conceptual development, and it would be good for a "real" programmer to take this on and write more sophisticated code than what I'm capable of.

This is a fork of the help_text.py script developed by Paul VandenBosch, KC8WBK.
Thanks Paul for your wx_server and help_text projects!
See Paul's projects at https://github.com/skyl4rk/

Instructions and examples for setting up the system can be found in the settings.py file.
